 "GP289","1","There are major conflicts in the various accounts of this family with the details of parentage given here. Looking at the details provided by Stirnet, one possibility is that she was daughter of Mary Widdrington (b.c. 1632, d. 1703), daughter of Sir Edward Widdrington of Cartington (d. 1671) and wife of Sir Edward Charleton of Hesleyside (d. 1674/5) (who were parents of four daughters, Mary, Catherine, Elizabeth and Christian, who married, according to the Register of the Estates of Roman Catholics in Northumberland in the 18th Century, p.3). The same source mentions the Will of Sir Edward Widdrington 1st bart of of Cartington's wife Christian Stuart, proved in 1684. Edward died without male issue and in her Will Christian mentions her daughters Mary Charlton and Catherine Hammond. However, Skeet, Life of Sir Edward Widdrington,p139, credits him with two wives. Burke's Extinct Peerage,p. 564, gives him a wife who was daughter of a Charlton of Hesleyside, assigning Mary wife of Sir Edward Charlton to the marriage (their daughter also marriage a Charlton cousin). Whoever Mary Charlton's mother was, Skeet and Burke between them would account for the data given for this nun, GP289. Further investigation is required but provisionally it would be reasonable to assume a brief first marriage for Sir Edward to a Charlton, before his subsequent much longer union with Christian Stuart. This would mean she was half-sister of Catherine LA036 and (half) great-aunt of Catherine Talbot HC061. KKR"
 "PA192","1","According to Stirnet (& family history) she was daughter of William Widdrington, 3rd Lord of Blankney (d. 1694/5) and Alathea Fairfax. Hence aunt of CB202 and niece of CB204, GP290 and OB143."
 "DB194","1","Daughter of a junior line of Yate of Lyford.

 "LA025","2"," This Mary does not occur amongst the issue recorded in Bedingfield Memorials for the alleged parentage, which seems doubtful on chronological grounds since this one was born about 1641. More likely is that she was the Mary, younger daughter of Edmund Bedingfield of Kirby Bedon and Elizabeth Tasburgh (Memorials, Table B), who was living on 19 July 1654 (before the entry of this nun into religion), and whose elder sister was born in 1633. Mary was said to have been 30 at her death in 1671, which may mean that her mother, whose death is given in Memorials op cit as 11 Feb 1640, died in childbirth. This Mary is said by the Chronicle of St Monica's Louvain to have been niece of Agnes Tasburgh, who was daughter of Sir John and his wife Lettice Cressie; her sister Elizabeth was wife of Edmund Bedingfield of Kirby Bedon. Edmund was cousin of Sir Henry Bedingfield of Oxburgh 'the Cavalier'."

Her father was a judge (Deempster) in the Isle of Man, possibly John Cannell who occurs in 1643. The family was persecuted as the only Catholics in the area and Henrietta was brought up largely by her grandmother Hesketh, her mother (daughter of a Thomas Hesketh of Meols) having at least 9 or 10 children. According to the notes to Crosby records, at least five of the children went into religion. Given the closeness in dates of the four Cannel(l) nuns, it is likely that all four were sisters.

 "OB140","2","This lady was evidently a kinswoman of Catherine Whetenhall abbess of Brussels BB194, who was daughter of Henry Whetenhall and his wife Lettice Tichborne; and also kinswoman of Elizabeth Anne Whetenhall PC124 who declared herself daughter of Thomas Whetenhall and Anne Saunders of Shankton and is said to have had a younger sister Catherine who died a pensioner at Paris in 1717. The three nuns were born between 1693 and 1699, with this lady the youngest. Probably they were cousins and two of them were sisters. Without further research the matter cannot be settled. One point, however, can  be cleared up. Foley, English Jesuits v, 802, thought that Henry Whetenhall S.J.'s grandfather Thomas was probably father of Henry and all three of these nuns, whereas one at least was certainly Henry's daughter and all three were contemporaries. Foley muddied the waters by reference to Henry?s father Thomas's second wife Elizabeth Bedingfield just before he speculates about Thomas as the father of Henry and the three nuns. The difficulty was noted in the Bedingfield Papers, p. 90 note, where it was noted that the Oxburgh pedigree of the Bedingfields showed that Elizabeth died without issue. That this was incontrovertibly the fact is shown by her epitaph in Peckham church, where she was buried aged 27 in 1664; it was written by her husband and stated that she died childless (transcribed in A Manor Through Four Centuries, AR Cook, Oxford, 1938, p. 40).

Their father had entertained Queen Elizabeth I in 1578 but died in prison at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in 1598 (Anstruther II, pp.271-2). Her cousin Ambrose Rookwood was executed in 1606 because of his part in the Gunpowder Plot."

Her father was of the Butler of Rawcliffe and Eccleston family. His personal name may derive from a link with the Orde family of Weetwood, Northmb. (Catholic Non-Jurors, p. 209). Distant relation of Dorothy Butler (GP059)"
 "AC021","1","Dates suggest she that she was a sister of Margaret (AC022). The name Fleetwood occurs among the daughters of Henry Butler of Rawcliffe and his wife Jane Stanley of Eccleston (Stirnet Butler16), who may have been her grand or great-grandparents."
 "DP027","1","The outlines of her parentage are given in her obit in the Chronicle. It has some support from William Blundell, Crosby records : A Cavalier's note book being Notes, anecdotes, & observations of William Blundell, of Crosby, Lancashire, esquire, p. 164. Her father was a judge (Deempster) in the Isle of Man, possibly John Cannell who occurs in 1643. The family was persecuted as the only Catholics in the area and Henrietta was brought up largely by her grandmother Hesketh, her mother (daughter of a Thomas Hesketh of Meols) having at least 9 or 10 children. According to the notes to Crosby records, at least five of the children went into religion. Given the closeness in dates of the four Cannel(l) nuns, it is likely that all four were sisters (DP028, GP061, GP062).

 "MW004","1","She was a pupil at the Bar Convent School. After profession she occupied nearly every office in the house. As Superior she increased the number of pupils and improved the financial position. She then carried out an extensive building programme, beginning with the hidden chapel (1669) and ending with the present Bar Convent faÃ§ade (1788) which completed the Georgian core of the convent. (CK-B)"
 "MW057","2","As Superior, influenced by the French emigrÃ© priests, she fostered a more monastic style of life. In 1816, being misinformed that Mary Ward's Institute no longer existed in Germany, she obtained permission from Rome for the Bar Convent to be placed under the authority of the Bishop, with strict enclosure. This separation from the main body of the Institute lasted until 1911. (CK-B)"
 "MW121","1","All that is known about her is that she was an early eighteenth century member of the bar Convent."
 "MW142","1","She was an heiress and when she entered she placed her estates at the disposal of the Bar Convent, thus relieving the house of the heavy burden of debt it had endured for many years. (CK-B)"

 "BF105","2","Her father was of the furniture-making family and her brother, Robert, died at the English College in Lisbon.  Her father was dismayed by her becoming a nun as he felt she should enjoy the way of life the family business meant she could (odnb Gillow family)."

 "LA058","6","Both her parents had accepted exile for their faith. John Clement instructed his only son and four daughters in Latin and Greek. Her mother was brought up in the house of the martyr, Thomas More, and was also conversant with these languages. They returned to England on the accession of Mary, but Margaret was unwilling to leave St Ursula's Louvain even though her father obtained a place for her with the Brigettines in England. She was instructed in religious life by Elizabeth Woodford (LA038), an English nun who had been given shelter by John Clement when ejected from her English monastery and had helped look after Margaret as a child. Margaret's sister, Dorothy, who had been a scholar in the convent with her, became a Poor Clare in Louvain. Margaret's appointment as superior in 1570 was contentious, she being an Englishwoman in a Flemish house and aged only about 30, but she skillfully led and reformed the house (Chronicle, 3-14). "
 "LA232","1","Of her transfer to St Monica's as founder member the Chronicle p89 notes 'Sister Mary Scidmore the youngest had promis of her uncle Sir Richard Farmer of 20 nobles a year, moreover because  she could play on the organs, and had other good parts was gladly taken with them'."
 "LA039","2","The Chronicle says she her mother was a niece of the earl of Southampton. Hamilton infers that she was sister [or possibly sister-in-law] of Thomas Wriothesley 4th earl of Southampton 1624-67, as inferred from the earl?s Will in which he speaks of his sister Brittan (Hamilton, Louvain I, 148). Chronologically, the Chronicle would seem to refer to the third earl (d. 1624), which makes better sense of describing her father?s children as cousins of Katherine Cornwallis, who was sister of the second earl. The details need further checking."

Where unto she answerd she knew not what to do, nor what would help her she was in such affliction of mind.  He answerd that he would bring her to one who should help her, she regarded not then his words being overwhelmed with affliction, but som days after he coming there again she desired him for Gods sake to bring her to one, as he had said the other day. Who thereupon brought her unto Father Garret [Gerard] who instructed her in Catholick religion and reconciled her wherupon her mind was so quieted that she becam contented. But yet she could take no pleasure in the world, therfore left the court and lived as the said Father appointed order for her.

After which time she was wery of her service, & therefore desired her father to place her with som other Catholick, for her father loved Catholicks, tho he were non himself, being so timorous that after his daughter was a Catholick he durst not lodg her any long time in his own house, but provided her a place with the old Lady Hudleston where she staid not long by reason that the lady was so fearful that priests came seldom to the house.  & she having been at her aunts, used continually to hear mass & confer with priests liked not this dry kind of life, therfore spoke unto them to provide her of som other place.

The entry for November 1700 about the raising of a tombstone clearly describes her as the widow of John Yate of Lyford Esquire and the mother 'to three of our religious'. Her son Charles Yate died in 1696 when she gave a 100 pounds as a present for a service and solemn mass performed by the nuns. Another son, John, was a canon regular of Notre-Dame du Val near Caen. He took charge of the debts owed by his mother to the convent in Feb 1700.
